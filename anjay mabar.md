> A **Rickroll** is one of the internet's most enduring "bait-and-switch" pranks. It involves tricking someone into clicking a link that they expect to be something interesting (like a movie trailer or news story), only to have it lead to the music video for Rick Astley’s 1987 hit song, **"Never Gonna Give You Up."**

**Here is the breakdown of how it started and why it’s still everywhere.**

## 1. The Origin: From "Ducks" to "Ricks"

The prank actually evolved from an earlier meme on the imageboard **4chan** called **"Duckrolling."** * In 2006, the site's founder (moot) played a prank by setting a word filter that changed the word "egg" to "duck."

- When people tried to post about "eggrolls," it appeared as **"duckrolls."** * A user then created a photoshopped image of a **duck on wheels**, and people began linking to it as a prank.
    
- In **May 2007**, a user named Shawn Cotter (who wanted to prank people looking for the highly anticipated _Grand Theft Auto IV_ trailer) swapped the duck for Rick Astley's music video. The "Rickroll" was born.
    

## 2. Why that song?

The song was chosen because it is the quintessential 80s pop track: catchy, upbeat, and featuring Rick Astley’s surprisingly deep baritone voice paired with his youthful appearance and signature "shuffling" dance moves. It strikes a perfect balance between being genuinely good music and being "cheesy" enough to work as a joke.

## 3. Famous Rickrolls in History

The meme went mainstream in 2008 and hasn't really left since:

- **YouTube's Prank:** On April Fools' Day 2008, YouTube linked every single "Featured Video" on its homepage to the song.
    
- **Macy’s Day Parade:** In 2008, Rick Astley himself came out of a float during the parade to "live Rickroll" millions of TV viewers.
    
- **The White House:** In 2011, the official White House Twitter account Rickrolled a user who complained that their feed was boring.
    
- **Foo Fighters:** The band famously Rickrolled the Westboro Baptist Church by driving past their protest in a truck blasting the song with Rick Astley himself on board.
    

## 4. How Rick Astley Feels About It

Initially, Astley found the whole thing "bizarre," but he has since fully embraced it. He has noted that it essentially revitalized his career and introduced his music to a whole new generation. In 2021, the official music video officially surpassed **1 billion views** on YouTube.

We're no strangers to love  
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinkin' of
